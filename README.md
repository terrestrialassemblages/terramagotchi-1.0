# Terramagotchi

## URL of the Website Where the Project Has Been Deployed

https://terramagotchi.web.app  
https://terramagotchi.web.app/remote

## Outline

Terramagotchi is a web app which aims to educate people about the cycles in nature and the processes which underlie them. The project is separated into 3 parts: The main application, the remote application, and the Firebase code.
* The main application is where the environment is simulated. It includes includes a simulation of nutrient and water transfer between soil, plants, and organisms, as well as water evaporation and condensation.
* The remote application is the interface that will enable users to authenticate and communicate to Firebase through an external device.
* The Firebase code is for deploying Firebase Cloud Functions that connect the main application and remote through a Firestore database.

## Usage - Instructions on How to Install and Setup the Project.

All dependencies have been listed above. See [Libraries](#libraries)

Prior to using these applications, you must have Node.js (with npm) installed on your machine.

As there are three sub-packages, each one must be installed/used separately.

Before building the project create a `.env` file at the root of the project containing the following variables.
```
// Firebase Variables
API_KEY=
AUTH_DOMAIN=
PROJECT_ID=
STORAGE_BUCKET=
MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
APP_ID=

// Instance Generation
RANDOM_INSTANCE="TRUE"

QR_DISPLAY_MODE="1"
```
The Firebase variables can be found in the General tab of Project settings in a Firebase web project.

To enable random instance generation, leave RANDOM_INSTANCE as "TRUE", otherwise remove this variable.

QR_DISPLAY_MODE sets the default display mode of the QR Code. 0 is hidden (Default), 1 is Overlayed, 2 is Fully covering the environment.

The display mode can be toggled with the period `.` key once running.

### Terramagotchi (Main Application)

Navigate to `./terramagotchi/` From here run the following commands:

#### Install

```
npm install
```

#### Development Server

```
npm run dev
```

You can now access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:9000/` in your browser.

#### Build

```
npm run build
```

This will build the application. It can then be accessed in the `dist` folder. To run the application, open the `index.html` file (found in said `dist` folder) in your browser.

### Terramagotchi-Firebase (Cloud functions)
To deploy this code, a new Firebase project must be created prior to deployment. This can be done by following [Firebase Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

Firebase tools is required to be installed globally using npm before deploying to the Firebase project.
```
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
```
Once logged in to an authorised Google account, you can install dependencies and deploy to the Firebase.
```
cd terramagotchi-firebase/functions
npm install
cd ..
npm install
firebase deploy
```
Global function variables within Firestore can be created in `!global/variables`, currently only `user_cooldown` is supported.

### Terramagotchi-Remote (User Remote)

Navigate to `./terramagotchi-remote/` From here run the following commands:

#### Install

```
npm install
```

#### Development Server

```
npm run dev
```

You can now access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:9001/` in your browser.

#### Build

```
npm run build
```

This will build the application. It can then be accessed in the `dist` folder. To run the application, open the `index.html` file (found in said `dist` folder) in your browser.

#### Hosting

The webpacked files can be hosting anywhere once built. For the remote to route properly the dist files for `terramagotchi-remote` must be routed with `/remote`.

If using firebase to host you can use the following `firebase.json` to route it correctly.
```js
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "public",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
      "rewrites": [ {
      "source": "**",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }, {
      "source": "/remote",
      "destination": "/remote/index.html"
    }]
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples (if available).

This project is an application which is made to be shown in an art gallery setting.

## Future Plan (Ideas for Future releases)

- Temperature and oxygen levels which affect the water and nutrient cycles. A high temperature would result in more transpiration. Oxygen levels would imply an additional carbon cycle system.
- Larger diversity of plants and organisms. Currently we have 3 plants, (lavendar, dandelion and kauri tree,) and one organism, (a worm).
